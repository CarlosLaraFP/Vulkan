Image: In Vulkan, an image (represented by VkImage) is a more general concept that refers to a block of memory used to store multidimensional, layered data. This data could be anything from texture data you'd sample in a shader to color or depth data you'd render to as part of a rendering pass. Images can have various formats, dimensions, and usage flags that define how they can be used within the API.

Framebuffer: A framebuffer in Vulkan (represented by VkFramebuffer) is more specific and represents a collection of images to be used as the target for rendering operations. A framebuffer references one or more image views (VkImageView), which define how the pipeline accesses the image data. These image views usually include a color attachment, and optionally depth/stencil attachments, among others. The framebuffer essentially defines the "output" of a rendering pass, specifying which images the rendering commands will write to.

Viewport: In Vulkan, a viewport is a structure that defines a part of the image that will be rendered to. It describes the transformation from the normalized device coordinates (NDC) space to the framebuffer coordinates space. Essentially, it specifies the region of the framebuffer that the output will be mapped to after the rasterization stage of the graphics pipeline.

The viewport defines several key characteristics:

Position and Size: It specifies the x, y coordinates for the top-left corner of the viewport within the framebuffer, as well as the width and height of the viewport. These dimensions define the rectangular area of the render target that will be drawn to.

Depth Range: The viewport also includes a depth range (minDepth and maxDepth), which is used to map the depth values of all fragments generated by the rasterization process. This range is typically set between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents the near plane and 1.0 represents the far plane of the depth buffer.

Viewports are important for rendering scenes where you want to control which portion of the image to render or when implementing features like split-screen views in a game or application.

Vulkan allows specifying multiple viewports and scissor rectangles (which define the actual pixels within the viewport that fragments can be written to) for a single pipeline, enabling more complex rendering setups, such as rendering to multiple portions of a window or render target simultaneously.

1. Object/Model Space: Coordinates are defined relative to the local origin of the geometric object. This is where vertices of a model typically start.

2. World Space: After applying the model transformation, coordinates are in a common space shared by all objects in the scene.

3. View/Camera Space: Applying the view transformation positions objects relative to the camera's viewpoint.

4. Clip Space: After the projection transformation, coordinates are in a space where they can be clipped against the view frustum. Vertices are then perspective-divided to go from clip space to NDC.

5. NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates): In this space, the x, y, and z coordinates are normalized to be within a standard cubic volume (in Vulkan, x and y range from -1.0 to 1.0, and z from 0.0 to 1.0 for the default depth range). This space is what the viewport transformation uses to map to framebuffer coordinates.

6. Framebuffer/Window Space: Finally, the viewport transformation maps NDC to the actual pixels in the framebuffer or the window surface being rendered to.

NDC is a crucial step in the pipeline that standardizes how geometry is represented before itâ€™s mapped onto the screen or the target framebuffer, ensuring consistent rendering across different hardware and graphics APIs.

In Vulkan, a rendering pass (VkRenderPass) represents a collection of operations that read from and write to specific portions of framebuffer attachments. It's a high-level concept that encapsulates one or more subpasses and their dependencies, and it's designed to be a concise description of your rendering pipeline's framebuffer usage. This encapsulation allows Vulkan to optimize the rendering process, especially on tile-based renderers commonly found in mobile devices.

How Rendering Pass Relates to Images and Framebuffers
Image: As mentioned earlier, an image in Vulkan (VkImage) is a block of memory that contains data, which can be anything from textures to color and depth information that you might render to during a rendering operation. When you're rendering something in Vulkan, you're generally writing to an image that's designated to be the color or depth buffer.

Framebuffer: A framebuffer (VkFramebuffer) in Vulkan is an object that references all the images (as attachments) that a rendering pass will use. This includes color attachments, depth/stencil attachments, and others that the render pass may output to or read from. It essentially defines the targets for rendering operations within a render pass.

Rendering Pass
A rendering pass involves the following concepts:

Attachments: These are the images that are used by the render pass. They can be inputs, outputs, or intermediate buffers used within the render pass. Attachments are described in the render pass creation with their format, sample count, and how their contents should be handled at the start and end of the render pass.

Subpasses: A render pass can consist of multiple subpasses. Each subpass can perform operations that read from, write to, or resolve attachments. Subpasses are designed to minimize output/input latency and memory bandwidth on tile-based renderers by allowing operations that use the same attachments to be batched together.

Dependencies: Explicit dependencies between subpasses can be defined to manage the ordering and synchronization of operations. This ensures correct rendering results when operations in different subpasses read from and write to the same attachments.

Relation to Framebuffer and Image
During the execution of a render pass, the operations defined in its subpasses are performed on the framebuffer's attachments. These attachments are backed by images, which store the actual pixel data. The render pass defines how these images are accessed and manipulated, allowing Vulkan implementations to optimize the rendering process.

For example, in a simple rendering scenario, you might have a render pass with a single subpass that writes to a color attachment. The color attachment is part of a framebuffer, which references a color image. The render pass specifies how the subpass interacts with this color attachment (e.g., clearing it at the start, writing to it, and then presenting it to the screen).

Benefits
The explicit nature of render passes and subpasses in Vulkan allows developers to provide detailed information about their rendering operations to the Vulkan driver. This enables more efficient use of hardware resources, particularly on tile-based rendering architectures, and can lead to significant performance optimizations in complex rendering pipelines.
